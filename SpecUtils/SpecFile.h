Shortcommings that wcjohns should address:
 - Many of the N24 fields possible are not checked for
    - comments for multiple different tags, ...
 - Neutron measurements should have their own live and real time
 - Neutron counts are typically merged into a gamma detectors Measurement if a
   reasonable pairing can be made. When and if this is done needs to be clearly
   specified, and either stopped of facilities added to keep neutron det. info.
   (should probably instead make own neutron info object (or more generally gross count) that can be
   associated with a Measurement, or maybe sample number, maybe multiple neutron to a Measurement)
    - This should be stopped.  It also solves the issue with neutron and gamma having own real/live
      times, as if they do differ, they can just be put in different Measurements
 - Should add a DetectorInfo object that Measurement objects point to and share.
   - Should add things like dimension and RadDetectorKindCode to this object,
     as well as characteristics (as defined in N42-2012, but in a few other file
     formats)
   - Should probably get rid of detector number, and just keep name
 - Should eliminate the <InterSpec:DetectorType> tag in written N42 2012 files.
 - Should consider adding explicit dead_time field
 - Should consider removing measurement_operator and inspection and make location
   part of detector location object
 - Should implement tracking N42 MeasurementGroupReferences to link Analysis
   with appropriate spectra, and InterSpec can use to link to peaks and such.
 - Should add in InstrumentToItemDistance and InstrumentToItemBearing to
 - There is a degeneracy in SpecFile between: detector_type_,
   instrument_type_, manufacturer_, and instrument_model_ - so this should
   be sorted out.
 - Should link derived spectra to analysis results (when applicable), and
   I'm not sure if the derived spectra should be in with the rest of the spectra
 - When multiple copies of data is included in file with different energy
   calibrations (different energy ranges, or linear vs log energy scale),
   currently denote this by artificaually creating new detector and adding
   "_intercal_<calid>" to its name; should impose a better mechanism to handle
   this.
 - the generated UUID should maybe be more stable with respect to just the
   spectroscopic information.
 - Should rename DetectorType to SystemType or DetectionSystemType
 - Should add in tag that indicates original file type, which will survive
   serialization to N42-2012 and back in
 - For analysis result should add information on what isotopes where in the
   alarm templates
 - Should add a Dose field to Measurement; see CountDose for a starting point
 - Should add in "Characteristics" a few places (for detectors, system,

/** Class that represents a spectrum file.
 
 Can be used to parse spectrum file from disk, or to create a file from a sensors measurement and
 write it out to disk.  This class may hold one or more #Measurement class objects that represents
 a spectrum and/or a neutron gross count from a physical sensor for a given time interval.
 
 This class kinda, sorta, roughly transforms input spectrum files to a N42-2012 like representation
 suitable for use as part of user-display, analysis, or other programs.
 
 An important concept is that a spectrum file may contain multiple spectra that may be from
 multiple different physical detectors, and from multiple time periods.  Different physical
 detectors are differentiated by #Measurement::detector_name(), and different time periods are
 differentiated by #Measurement::sample_number(), such that usually all spectra that share a common
 time period will all have the same sample number.  A single #Measurement can be uniquely specified
 by a combination of sample number and detector name.
 
 Example of reading a spectrum file and printing out a partial summary of its information, and then
 saving to a different file format is:
