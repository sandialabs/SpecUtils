/** For some detector models, most notable Ortec HPGe detectors, the exact model
    of the detector may not be included in the file.  However, it can be
    important to know the exact model to use the correct detector response
    function (DRF).
 
    For example using a EX100 DRF for data taken with an Micro will give you
    about a factor of four off for Cs137; worse, if you are fitting for
    shielding amount (for an isotope with multiple photopeaks), you will get the
    wrong shielding amount/type, which may throw your answer off even more.
 
    This namespace allows you to read in a CSV file that maps serial number to
    detector model, so the correct one can be assigned at the time of parsing
    the files.
